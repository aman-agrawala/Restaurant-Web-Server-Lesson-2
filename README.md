# Restaurant-Web-Server-Lesson-2
This code is for a simple local webserver written in python that displays restaurants and their respective menu items.
This project will eventually move from using BaseHTTPServer in Python to Flask.

In order to get this code up and running, it is expected that you are familiar with Python, and SQLAlchemy. Please see https://www.python.org/ for more information on installing and setting up python by yourself. Please see http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/core/tutorial.html for setting up SQLAlchemy. Furthermore, it is advised to install vagrant on your own machine to get all additional programs quickly intsalled. Please see this link for more details on this process: https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud197/install-vagrant.
